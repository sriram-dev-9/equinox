## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Errors**
   - Ensure all environment variables are properly set
   - Check that API keys are valid and have proper permissions

2. **Tool Execution Failures**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify database connections for watchlist access
   - Ensure Finnhub API limits aren't exceeded

3. **Chat Not Loading**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify the API route is accessible at `/api/chat`
   - Ensure user is properly authenticated

### Debug Mode
Set environment variable `NODE_ENV=development` to see detailed logging in the console.

## Security Considerations

- API keys are server-side only and never exposed to the client
- User authentication is required to access the chat feature
- Tool execution is limited to read-only operations on user data
- Web scraping is limited to trusted financial websites

## Performance

- Responses typically take 2-5 seconds depending on tool usage
- Tool execution is optimized with caching where possible
- Chat history is stored in memory and resets on page refresh
- Consider implementing persistent chat history for production use

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Streaming responses for real-time typing effect
- [ ] Voice input/output capabilities
- [ ] Chart and graph generation
- [ ] Integration with more financial data sources
- [ ] Persistent chat history with database storage
- [ ] Custom alerts and notifications
